This is going to be our world example:

![[World Example.png|600]] ^4dd056

To store #informations about our world, we'll be using #true and #false statement like in [[Reminder of Propositional Logic|Propositional Logic]]

A fact could be this (with B that stands for breeze):

$$ B_{3, 2} = True $$
$$ B_(1, 3) = False $$

We can also use more complex logical #expressions too, not only simple #booleans.

The #agent will be able to get and use #knowledge with 2 functions that are #tell and #ask.

A #percept #sequence is a #history of what the #agent perceives and does. To do so in our #algorithm, we can use #sensors that can give #information about the world.
