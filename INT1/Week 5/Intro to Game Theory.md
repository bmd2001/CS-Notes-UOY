#Game Theory is based on the idea that the #problem that there are one or more #agents that interact with the #problem. We call the #problem the #game and the #agent are the #players, that try to take the best action possible.

When we are in a #game, **we can't assume** that the player will be helping us, so we're going to predict the worst case #scenario.

#Communication can be a factor, but we aren't going to talk about it for now.

To quantify the outcome of the #game, we can use a numerical value called #utility.

How you calculate the #utility value is based on the type of the #game is being played:
to do so, different #games are divided in two categories:

1) #Zero-Sum: there aren't scenarios where everyone loses or everyone wins ^c3d12b
2) #General-Sum: the scenarios non accepeted by #Zero-Sum are accepted in these games

#Utility is written as a #tuple like this: (P1, P2). In a #Zero-Sum #game one player's value is the negative of the other, in a #General-Sum #game, the P2 value can be omitted.
