Knowing completely what the project is required to do is a very import factor of Software Engineering. #RE is used to understand the context and understand and communicate the requirements with the clients.
The participants of the #RE are stakeholders or employees of the company (and colleagues involved in the project).

A #SSON (Single Statement Of Need) is a very short statement that describes what the final outcome of the project should be. Then, the #user #requirements are the tasks that the users will be able to do while using the final product (these tasks don't have to be technical). The last point is the #system #requirements are all the #requirements that the hardware, the software and the final product will need.
A #fit #criterion is a sentence that is a translation of the will of the client, and it uses terms that quantify the requirement.

There are five modes in which the system could be in:

1) Operational
2) Training (the staff is getting trained on how to use it)
3) Degraded (some parts aren't usable/reachable)
4) Maintenance
5) Idle/Stand By

Requirements should be stored with unique IDs so that they can be easily followed and checked. Usually, the requirements are stored in 3 tables for User and Software Functional and Non-Functional requirements.

To map the requirements easily and understand what the responses of the product should be, we can use a #use #case diagram (easily done using [[Object-Oriented Modelling with UML|UML]]):
