Planning is very important, and you can't stop planning until the end of the project. While doing so, we have to keep in mind that plans continue to evolve and that there could be other constraints involved (budgeting, time etc.).

There are four stages in Project Planning:

1) [[Project Planning and Risk Management#^976c31|Project Organization]]
2) [[Project Planning and Risk Management#^941830|Resources]]
3) [[Project Planning and Risk Management#^fdd579|Project Schedule]]
4) [[Project Planning and Risk Management#^a21ee3|Risk Management Plan]]

# Project Organization

There's the delivery of the team, where roles and departments are assigned. It's when we understand the initial will of the customers. It's also the part where communication routine between the team and/or the customer is set. ^976c31

# Resources

Hardware and software requirements. They can come from the customer itself or by the needs of the other members of the team. ^941830

# Project Schedule

The main thing of this stage is the breaking down of the work into different tasks and allocating them to different people and giving them a duration estimate. There has to be upfront scheduling straight away if there are deadlines and the amount of organization needed is a lot (e.g. the team is huge). In the scheduling process, there are four main components that we have to have: ^fdd579

1) Work Packages
2) Tasks (subsection of the Work Packages)
3) Deliverable (documentation or software)
4) Milestones (important achievements)

To schedule a project, #Gantt Charts are usually used because they show all the four elements above in one place.

Being pessimistic with timing and expected duration of tasks is a good thing to do while scheduling because, in case of disruptions or accidents, you still have time to reschedule and finish the work in time.

# Risk Management Plan

^a21ee3

There are known and unknown risks, but they all can be divided in four groups:

1) Project risks
2) Product risks
3) Product and project risks
4) Business risks

There are also four stage in the Risk Management Process:

1) Risk Identification
2) Risk Analysis
3) Risk Planning
4) Risk Monitoring

We can use a Risk Register too, that helps us keep track of all the problem that the team has encountered:
