#UML provides 4 types of #diagrams:

1) Class diagrams
2) Sequence diagrams
3) State diagrams
4) Component diagrams

We're going to use #prescriptive models (the opposite of #descriptive models), so models that describe a system that doesn't exist yet.

There are tools that simulate systems through models (like Matlab Simulink).

These are the example of the 4 types of diagrams:
