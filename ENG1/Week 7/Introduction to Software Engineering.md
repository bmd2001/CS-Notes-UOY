# What is software engineering?

It's the systematic process of developing lasting #software in a team, using computer science knowledge.

How can we create #software from an #idea or a #request from a client? How can we #update #software that has already been deployed to a lot of machines?

To do so, we use #lifecycles (that are #models, not answers to those questions).

#Lifecycles usually describe these #activities:

1) Requirements analysis
2) Specification and Design
3) Implementation
4) Testing
5) Delivery/Deployment
6) Maintenance

The #waterfal, produced in 1970, was an the first ideal process to create a piece of #software. It is not a #model and it is usually used to solve small developing problems.

The #spiral #model instead tried to make #developers think more about the goals and risks before coming to the #developing and testing part.

# Developing #methods

They're very high level and different depending on what the #project #context is.

There are three categories of #methods, based on the information we have about the #project #context:

- Plan-driven
- Agile
- Soft

### Plan-driven #methods 

These methods follow a #guideline, a #roadmap of what are the steps to take. There's always the risk to be to burocatric, that's why [[#^3bac97|agile methods]] were invented. This #method works quite well if the software that we want to develop is not going to be changed or update quite regurarly.
#Documentation is also a key aspect of plan-driven methods, because it allows us to communicate ideas and information easily in the team and with the customer. #Documentation isn't helpful though if distracts people from the development process or it's not really used in it.

An example can be #RUP, model created by IBM.

User's stories are also used in later stages of #development. The objective of #RUP is to translate these stories in #Object #oriented programs.

### Agile #methods

These methods cope with changes. We can do so by:

- Running short iteration cycles (review every x time)
- Low documentation overhead
- Continuous feedback with customer

The #OODA loop comes from the military and it is used as an agile method.

This is the #manifesto of the agile methods:

You can use agile methods in flexible project enviroment and in a small team. Scrum is a method, where you talk about what you did the day before and what you need to do on the day before every working day:
