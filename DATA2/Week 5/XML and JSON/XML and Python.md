To start with #python and #xmldoc you need to import the library first

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as xmldoc
```
This will allow you to create [[XML]] documents with #python commands.
For the rest of the commands check the [[Lab 9 XML#^98ead2|lab sheet]] or the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html)
