# What is #JSON?

It's an extension of #JavaScript (in fact the #acronym stands for Java Script #Object #Notation).
It's simple to write, takes less memory than #xml and it can be used with most modern #languages.

# How to use #JSON 
#JSON has 6 #data #types:

1) #strings
2) #numbers
3) #booleans
4) #nulls
5) #objects (collection of keys and associated values)
6) #arrays (collection of values or objects)

#Objects are written like #dictionaries in #python.
#Objects can also be #nested.
#Arrays instead are like #lists in #python.
