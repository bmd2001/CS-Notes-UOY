In research studies, the #hypothesis have to be verified with **statistical tests**. They can be divided into #Parametric and #Non-Parametric ( #Distribution-free ) tests. The #Parametric were covered in DATA1.

The #parameters (such as mean or std of a sample data set) are not used in #Non-Parametric tests. They don't make assumptions of the entire population based on data of a sample test.

We use #Non-Parametric tests if:

1) If #Parametric tests aren't satisfying
2) No distribution
3) Small sample size
4) Unscaled data
5) Lot of outliers
