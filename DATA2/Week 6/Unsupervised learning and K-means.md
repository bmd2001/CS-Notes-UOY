#Machine #learning is usually described in two ways:

1) Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
2) Study of the computer programs to automatically improve through experience.

Machine learning can be used for various needs like:

1) Spam Emails
2) Book recommendation
3) Vocal Patterns
4) Tumor cells as benign or not
5) Genuine credit card transactions

There are two #machine #learning types:

1) [[Supervised Learning and Logistic Regression]] ( #classification )
2) #Unsupervised #learning ( [[#^a17adc|#clustering]] )

In #supervised #learning, the data has clear labels, so the role of the program will be to create a predictive model using this data and, based on whether the program predicts correctly or not, a score is given back to the program to make the prediction fit better.

In #unsupervised #learning instead, the data does not have clear labels, but it's the predictive model that studies the data and tries to find how to divide the data into groups. One approach to do so is to use the [[Lab 12 Unsupervised learning and K-means clustering algorithm|k-means]] method that we used in the Lab 12's session. 

There are pros and cons of using #k-means, like for every #method. Some examples are:

1) PAM
2) Fuzzy C-means
3) Mixture of Gaussian
4) Search-Based
