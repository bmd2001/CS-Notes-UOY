## Volume

^7488d2

Huge amounts of data can be collected and help the understanding of big population. But how can you store it, and how can you process this?

## Variety

^bfca2c

It can cope with data that #SQL can't handle. You still can't do it easily though because the stored data will feel meaningless and the queries to retrieve the data will be complicated.

## Velocity

^e4bc0d

It can react quickly to changes and different circumstances, but still have to react to changes quickly enough.

## Veracity

^819553

You can have veracity only if the values are controlled and up to data, but that takes a long time and great resources.

## Value

^b9a39f

It has a lot of value if the data is rich in all the other previous Vs, but all the cons make it more difficult to have a high value.
