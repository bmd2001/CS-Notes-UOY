# Attention

#Attention is what gives us humans the ability to focus on a specific thing that we should find interesting and/or important. Other than that, it is very difficult to find a way to describe what exactly is #attention.

We found 2 different types of attention:

1) #Selective #attetion
2) #Divided #Attention

## Selective Attention

It's when we focus on one thing or action. This can easily be disturbed by something unscripted happens around us (if someone calls us, look at the cocktail effect).

This gives us a tendency to perceive a few aspects of the #sensory #data, but not everything. The perceived aspects are called the #Perceptual #Set.

*Example*:

This is why parts of the #UI of a #system should also be where the user expects them to be (because of previous experiences or of its culture), not only where they're more visible.

## Divided Attention

We can perform multiple actions or focus on two things at the same time: that's called #divided #attention.

We need to know that #users won't always won't have great understanding of something that needs #divided #attention to work, since this is less effective than [[Attention#Selective Attention|selective attention]].
