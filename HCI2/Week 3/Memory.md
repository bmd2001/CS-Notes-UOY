# Memory

There are three types of #memory:

1) #Sensory memory
2) #Working memory
3) #Long-term memory

### Sensory Memory

This is the #memory that stores #sensory feedback that our body perceives. This happens unconsciously, and the information is stored for a small amount of time, even if this type of #memory has a very large #capacity.

### Working Memory

When the information is retrieved consciously by the person, this moves to the #working #memory. This memory doesn't store information very efficiently, unless you use a few #memory techniques (rehearsal ...).

[George Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two) theorized that the #working #memory consists of $7 \pm 2$ slots of information (a human can memorize, in theory, a password that is 9 [or a number in the range] characters long). This concept is overly used in #HCI, though. For example, menus on a website don't have more than 9 different links, even though the entries don't have to be memorized, but only recognized.

### Long Term Memory

Long term is the #memory that stores the information that we tried to memorize with specific techniques or that have a great #emotional impact on us. It's believed its #capacity is infinite. The information can be still forgotten.

There are two broad types of Long Term #memory:

1) Declarative (knowing things)
2) Procedural (knowing how to do things. This is harder to verbalize)

In #HCI, we can use #properties of our #long-term #memory to our advantage, too.

##### How can we retrieve information from our Long Term Memory?

Humans are better at doing so if they have any additional information that links the question to their memories ( #cued #recall), compared to only asking the question (free recall)

*Example*:

> "What did you do on the 19<sup>th</sup> May 2018?"
> 
> "What did you do on the 19<sup>th</sup> May 2018, the Royal Wedding's day?"

That's why technologies are trying to implement more #cued #recall, like with the use of #graphical #passwords.
