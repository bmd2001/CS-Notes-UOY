# Cognitive Modeling

The base of [[HCI2 Intro#^96c32f|cognitive models]] in the [[HCI2 Intro#First Wave|First Wave]] are questions about the system and technologies and how the user could interact with them to reach a goal.

*Example*:

1) How much time does it take you to order a pizza on the Deliveroo App?
2) How many steps did it take?
3) Were you confused while doing so?

<mark>Cognitive models</mark> are methods that, while they divide a main task in different #subtasks to reach a specific goal, give back information about the <u>user behavior</u> and the <u>systems responses</u>.
