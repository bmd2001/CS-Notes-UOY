# Cognitive Modelling

The base of [[HCI2 Intro#^96c32f|cognitive models]] in the [[HCI2 Intro#First Wave|First Wave]] are questions about the system and technologies and how the user could interact with them to reach a goal.

*Example*:

1) How much time does it take you to order a pizza on the Deliveroo App?
2) How many steps did it take?
3) Were you confused while doing so?

<mark>Cognitive models</mark> are methods that, while they divide a main task in different #subtasks to reach a specific goal, give back information about the <u>user behaviour</u> and the <u>systems responses</u>.

*Example*:

#GOMS (Goals, Operators (or actions), Methods and Selection)

# User Capabilities

#Users can have different capabilities and they have to be taken in account. Failing to do so can affect people lives a lot and in many ways.

HCI research has moved away from cognitive models, but these are absolutely essential to a creation of a good technology.

### Vision

The #eye's perceptive cells are:

1) Cones (high level light and color perception)
2) Rods (low level light but no color perception)

Knowing how #periphery works is also helpful. In fact, humans usually move their eyes ( #saccades ) if they perceive that something is in their #peripheric area. During night though, even if this eye movements will still work, #peripheric #vision would be more useful, since we have more rods (that can perceive better in a lower light environment).

Important information can be shown using this knowledge: if an error message as to be shown to the screen, it can be placed in the #fovea (focal area) or it can be placed somewhere else if this is also moving or attracting other people's attention.

We have to think about color #vision deficiencies too because we need to adapt to make sure the users don't get confused with our color selection. To do so, we can use colors that have high contrast or use colors that can be easily perceived.

### Auditory Perception

#Sound originates from vibration of objects that create waves that travel through air.

There are two systems in our body:

1) #Transmission system (amplifies the sound wave in our ear)
2) #Transduction system (converts the wave into neural impulses to the nerves)

Our ears also have a #localization system, that helps us understand whereabout a sound is coming from.

Musical #patterns can also be remembered easily by our brains.

<br>

### Haptic Perception

This is the #tactile perception that helps us understand what we're feeling (pain, pressure, heat, vibrations ...) and where in our body.

With this the #proprioperception comes along, where this is the perception of physical characterisitcs of other objects and utensils.
