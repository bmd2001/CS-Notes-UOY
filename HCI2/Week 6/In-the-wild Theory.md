## External Cognition

#External #cognition is when we use tools and objects to help us with cognitive tasks (memorization, computation, annotation and cognitive tracing), such as:

1) Google Calendar
2) Excel
3) Evernote
4) Organize files in folders

This concept can also be linked to [[Ubiquitous Computing#^c4a354|blended spaces]].

<br>

## Distributed Cognition

#Distributed #cognition is when difficult tasks are subdivided into different tasks that are performed by different people and systems to achieve one or a small set of objectives.

*Example*:

## Activity Theory

#Activity #Theory provides a #framework to look how at the relationships between people and the #context in which they are can shape the way activities are done.

It's the opposite of [[Cognitive Modelling and User Capabilities#^1d741f|GOMS]].

#Activity #Theory has two different generations.

## Situated Action

Differently from a #cognitive approach, #Situated #Action focuses on understanding the #cause of a particular action in a particular #setting.

Our actions are #situated: we try to do our best at every# interaction, even if it doesn't follow a plan. We afterwards explain our #actions as they were based on plans, so plans are just ways to communicate our experience to others.

For this reason, #communication and #coordination are two key #concepts in #Situated #Action.
