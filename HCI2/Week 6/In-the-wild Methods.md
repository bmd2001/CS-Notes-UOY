# In-the-wild Methods

<br>

## Observation

<br>

We can divide different types of #observation into 3 types:

1) "Quick and dirty" (looking at a similar technology that has already been implemented)
2) In field studies (starting a case study about the effectiveness of the product)
3) In the lab (*not discussed in the module*)

*Example*:

[OmniTracs](https://www.omnitracs.com/) and their QualComm GPS system for lorry drivers.


### Level of observer involvement

1) Total outsider
2) Observer that also participates (maybe disguised)
3) Partial/complete participants

### Tips
1) Notes
2) Camera pictures
3) Checklists of behaviours (especially good if the observation is hypothesis-driven)
4) Audio Recording
5) Videos

### Frameworks for field observations

To record the most important information as possible, it is useful to think about a #framework before starting the observation stage.

*Example*:

### Ethics of observation

Getting people's consent is very important (in any situation üòâ), especially when the observation activity is done in public (üòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòâ).

## Ethnography

#Ethnography is the branch of #anthropology that tries to study the #culture of a #community.

> **Culture**: ‚Äú*The set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization, or group*‚Äù

To do so, we have to have an insider (emic) #perspective (not an outsider [etic] one) to represent the experiences of different people.

An ethnographic #study could be done to:

1) Challenge assumptions
2) Specifying details of the technology
3) Uncover aspects of how the technology works in a real context
4) Understanding user's interactions with the technology

*Example*:

[The photocopier study](https://youtu.be/cNJWafS-BA4)

#Ethnography is also a very long process and requires trained researchers, but it gives a way better look of the cultural phenomenon.

## Contextual Enquiry

This method consists in asking questions and observing while the users are conducting tasks.

There are four #principles in #Contextual #Enquiry:

1) #Context
2) #Partnership
3) #Interpretation (check your #interpretations with the user)
4) #Focus (the #focus needs to stay on the relevant information)

The stage of #Contextual #Enquiry:

1) Conventional interview (15 mins)
2) Transition (30 sec)
3) Contextual interview (1.5/2 hrs)
4) Wrap-up (15 mins)
