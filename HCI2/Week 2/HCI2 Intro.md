# Key developments in Computer Science
<br>

The ideas of #Web and Personal Computers ( #PC ) were already formulated by Vannevar Bush in 1945.

The first graphic system ( #Sketchpad ) was created by [Ivan Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) in 1963.

The #mouse was created in the same year too and it was preffered to the pen used in the #Sketchpad.

In the 70's the first #PCs come to life, but in 1981 the [Xerox Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star) was the first bussiness focued #PC, and it also had a #GUI.

In the 1980-1990's the first [[Introduction To Operating system services|OSs]] are built and published on cheaper machines.

#Websites, mobile phones, self-service machines (ATMS, ...), medical equipment, videogames, #IoT (Internet of Things: like Apple Watches, Home assistants, ...) and Voice assistants are all other technologies that have been developed and perfected during these year.

# The 3 Waves

This concept comes from a Susanne Bødker paper and they are:

1) [[#First Wave]]: Cognitive Psychology and Human Factors
2) [[#Second Wave]]: Actors, Systems and Goals
3) [[#Third Wave]]: Experience and Meaning-Making

<br>

## First Wave

In the First #Wave, the focus is on the interaction between the computer and the #user (only one interaction). The users are usally seen as a living computer, with different tasks that they want to achieve. There were a lot of lab studies, but no real focus on real life applications.

*Example* :

## Second Wave

In the Second #Wave, the idea that humans are only trying to achieve goals through technology is left behind: humans are now regarded as #individuals that change ideas. Users are active agents, that have needs that they want to each while they're in a specific physical and social #context.

Networking is also rising, so teams in offices enviroments can easily communicate, share information and plan ahead.

<br>

## Third Wave

In the Third #Wave, technology is in humans' everyday life. It's the opposite of the Second Wave, so the main focus is on the non work aspects. The experience is also a key factor in newer technologies. There also different ways we can use a technology.

A user experience is way more than enjoyment.
