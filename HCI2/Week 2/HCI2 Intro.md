# Key developments in Computer Science
<br>

The ideas of #Web and Personal Computers ( #PC ) were already formulated by Vannevar Bush in 1945.

The first graphic system ( #Sketchpad ) was created by [Ivan Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) in 1963.

The #mouse was created in the same year too and it was preffered to the pen used in the #Sketchpad.

In the 70's the first #PCs come to life, but in 1981 the [Xerox Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star) was the first bussiness focued #PC, and it also had a #GUI.

In the 1980-1990's the first [[Introduction To Operating system services|OSs]] are built and published on cheaper machines.

#Websites, mobile phones, self-service machines (ATMS, ...), medical equipment, videogames, #IoT (Internet of Things: like Apple Watches, Home assistants, ...) and Voice assistants are all other technologies that have been developed and perfected during these year.
