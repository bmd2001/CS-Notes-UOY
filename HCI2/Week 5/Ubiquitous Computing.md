# Ubiquitous Computing

> *Ubiquitous* : Seeming to be everywhere

> **Cambridge Dictionary**

Already in 1991, researchers started to think about how #ubiquitous #technology could become in the following years. In fact, technologies were going to become more and more #seamless, invisible to the human perception.

Things have changed since then, but **can and do we have seamless interactions with technologies?**

In the 2003 we start to have more researches agreeing with another theory: technology's designs enhance the user's experience if they share their properties and more of how they work.

## How can you design ubiquitous/pervasive technologies?

information) space that have been brought together to
create the opportunities for new experiences”

Another example can be the Poetry Garden in Edinburgh, where people passing by could learn more about #poetry through the installations there (a QR code sculpture or a sound system in the trees).
