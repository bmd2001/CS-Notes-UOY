# The pervasiveness of technology

Since the #third #wave as become the main way we approach #technology, this as become more and more #pervasive and a bigger part of our daily lives.

Products that try to be more #pervasive are, for example:

1) Voice Control Interfaces (Echo Dots, Google Assistants, HomePods ...)
2) #VR
3) #AR
4) Wearables (fitness or smartwatches)
5) Touch Screen Displays (for interactive purposes)

Even art, cultural experiences and performances are getting more and more #interactive.

A few examples are:

4) [Squeezy Green Balls](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2967934.2968102)

All of these examples give back to the user a thought-provoking experience.
