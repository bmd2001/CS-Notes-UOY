Products that try to be more #pervasive are, for example:

1) Voice Control Interfaces (Echo Dots, Google Assistants, HomePods ...)
2) #VR
3) #AR
4) Wearables (fitness or smartwatches)
5) Touch Screen Displays (for interactive purposes)

Even art, cultural experiences and performances are getting more and more #interactive.

A few examples are:
